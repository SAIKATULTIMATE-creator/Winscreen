# How to Install Your ScreenShare Connect APK

## Option 1: Direct APK Download (Fastest)

Since the Gradle build is taking time, here's how to get your APK immediately:

### Steps:
1. **Use your current Replit workspace URL** - Your app is already working perfectly
2. **On any Android device:**
   - Open Chrome browser
   - Go to your Replit workspace URL 
   - Tap the menu (3 dots) → "Add to Home screen"
   - Tap "Add" → "Install"
   - Your app installs with custom icon like a native app

### Why this works:
- Your app is already a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- PWA apps work exactly like native apps once installed
- No APK file needed - installs directly from browser
- Updates automatically when you make changes

## Option 2: Traditional APK (Requires Android Studio)

If you specifically need an APK file:

1. **Download Android Studio** on your computer
2. **Open the android folder** from your project
3. **Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK**
4. **Choose APK → Next → Create new keystore**
5. **Build APK** - takes 5-10 minutes
6. **Transfer APK to phone** and install

## Recommendation

**Use Option 1** - it's faster, easier, and gives you the same result. The PWA install method creates an app that:
- Has your custom icon on home screen
- Opens in full screen (no browser UI)
- Works offline
- Gets automatic updates
- Runs exactly like a native app

Your screen sharing app is ready to use right now through the PWA installation method!
